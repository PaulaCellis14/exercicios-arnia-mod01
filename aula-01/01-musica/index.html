        <h1>Simple Man</h1>
        
        <h2>Lynyrd Skynyrd</h2>

        <p>
            Mama told me when I was young <br />
            Come sit beside me, my only son <br />
            And listen closely to what I say <br />
            And if you do this, it'll help you some sunny day <br />
            Oh, yeah
        </p>

        <p>(Be a simple man)</p>

        <p>
            Oh, take your time, don't live too fast <br />
            Troubles will come and they will pass <br />
            Go find a woman and you'll find love <br />
            And don't forget, son, there is someone up above
        </p>

        <p>
            And be a simple kind of man <br />
            Oh, be something you love and understand <br />
            Baby, be a simple kind of man <br />
            Oh, won't you do this for me, son <br />
            If you can?
        </p>

        <p> 
            Forget your lust for the rich man's gold <br />
            All that you need is in your soul <br />
            And you can do this, oh, baby, if you try <br />
            All that I want for you, my son <br />
            Is to be satisfied <br />
            And be a simple kind of man <br />
            Oh, be something you love and understand <br />
            Baby, be a simple kind of man <br />
            Oh, won't you do this for me, son <br />
            If you can?
        </p>

        <p>(Oh, yes, I will)</p>

        <p>
            Boy, don't you worry, you'll find yourself <br />
            Follow your heart and nothing else <br />
            And you can do this, oh, baby, if you try <br />
            All that I want for you, my son <br />
            Is to be satisfied <br />
            And be a simple kind of man <br />
            Oh, be something you love and understand <br />
            Baby, be a simple kind of man <br />
            Oh, won't you do this for me, son <br />
            If you can?
        </p>

        <p>
            Baby, be a simple, be a simple man <br />
            Oh, be something you love and understand <br />
            Baby, be a simple kind of man <br />
